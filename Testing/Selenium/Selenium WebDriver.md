# WebDriver
- Each brower has its own driver on which the application runs. Selenium WebDriver makes direct calls to the brower.
- For testing on local machine, you need to use WebDriver. But for testing on a remote machine, you need Selenium RC Server to be running before testing.
- While testing on a remote machine, commands from WebDriver go to Selenium RC Server which is then interpreted on remote machine to automate the browser.
