# Selenium
Test automation has specific advantages for improving the long-term efficiency of a software team’s testing processes.  
Test automation supports:
1. Frequent regression testing  
2. Rapid feedback to developers  
3. Virtually unlimited iterations of test case execution  
4. Support for Agile and extreme development methodologies  
5. Disciplined documentation of test cases  
6. Customized defect reporting  
7. Finding defects missed by manual testing

Selenium is a set of different software tools each with a different approach to supporting test automation.  

The entire suite of tools results in a rich set of testing functions specifically geared to the needs of testing of web applications of all types.
