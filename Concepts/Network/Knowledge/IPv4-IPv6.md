## IPv4  
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP).  
It still routes most Internet traffic today,[1] despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.  

- IPv4 is a connectionless protocol for use on packet-switched networks. 
- It operates on a best effort delivery model, in that it does not guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are addressed by an upper layer transport protocol, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  

IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses which limits the address space to 4294967296 (232) addresses.  
IPv4 reserves special address blocks for private networks (~18 million addresses) and multicast addresses (~270 million addresses).  

## IPv6
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet.     
IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.
