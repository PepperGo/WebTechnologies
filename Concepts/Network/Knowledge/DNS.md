## DNS(Domain Name System)
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.   

The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces.   
The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces.   
Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.
