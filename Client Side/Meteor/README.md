## Meteor
Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for building web and mobile apps. Meteor makes it easier to create real-time apps, since it alone offers a full ecosystem to work with, instead of combining couple of different tools and frameworks to get the same effect.  

Official Documentation:
Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.  

### Features
- Web and Mobile − Meteor offers a platform for developing Web, Android and IOS apps.
- Universal Apps − The same code for web browsers and mobile devices.
- Packages − Huge number of packages that are easy to install and use.
- Meteor Galaxy − Cloud service for Meteor app deployment.

### Advantages
- Developers only need JavaScript for server and client side development.
- Coding is very simple and beginner friendly.
- Meteor apps are real time by default.
- Official and community packages are huge time saver.  

### Limitations
- Meteor isn't very suitable for large and complex applications.  
- There is a lot of magic going on when working with Meteor, so developers might find themselves limited in some way.
