# Play Tutorials  

Note: The Play APIs for Java and Scala are separated into different packages. All the Java APIs are under the play package; all the Scala APIs are under play.api.  
For example, the Java MVC API is under play.mvc and the Scala MVC API is under play.api.mvc.

## HTTP programming
### 1. Actions, Controllers and Results  
Most of the requests received by a Play application are handled by an action. An **action** is basically a Java method that processes the request parameters, and produces a result to be sent to the client.  
A **controller** is nothing more than a class extending play.mvc.Controller that groups several action methods.  
These **results** are defined by play.mvc.Result, and the play.mvc.Results class provides several helpers to produce standard HTTP results, such as the ok method.  

### 2. HTTP routing  
The router is the component that translates each incoming HTTP request to an action call (a public method in a controller class).  
An HTTP request is seen as an event by the MVC framework. This event contains two major pieces of information:
1. the request path (such as /clients/1542, /photos/list), including the query string.  
2. the HTTP method (GET, POST, â€¦).  



3. Manipulating the HTTP response
4. Session and Flash scopes
5. Body parsers
6. Actions composition
7. HTTP Request Handlers / ActionCreator
8. Content negotiation
