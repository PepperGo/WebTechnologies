# Meteor

## What is Meteor?
Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications.   
Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.
1. Meteor allows you to develop in **one language**, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.  
2. Meteor uses **data on the wire**, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it.  
3. Meteor **embraces the ecosystem**, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.  
4. Meteor provides **full stack reactivity**, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.
