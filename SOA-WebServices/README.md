RESTful Web Services are basically REST Architecture based Web Services. ESTful web services are light weight, highly scalable and maintainable and are very commonly used to create APIs for web-based applications. 
1. RESTful Web Services - Introduction  
   REST stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer.
   In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and the REST client accesses and presents the resources. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ Global IDs.  
   REST uses various representations to represent a resource like Text, JSON and XML. JSON is now the most popular format being used in Web Services.   
   HTTP Methods(commonly used in a REST based architecture): GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, OPTIONS  
   **A web service** is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems.   
   Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer.   
   Web services based on REST Architecture are known as RESTful Web Services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), which is a service that provides resource representation such as JSON and a set of HTTP Methods.
