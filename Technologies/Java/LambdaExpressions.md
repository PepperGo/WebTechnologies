# Java Lambda Expressions

Java lambda expressions are new in Java 8.   
Java lambda expressions are Java's first step into functional programming.   
A Java lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without belonging to any class.   
A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
