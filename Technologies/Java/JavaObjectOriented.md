## Java - Inheritance
Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.  

The class which inherits the properties of other is known as **subclass (derived class, child class)** and the class whose properties are inherited is known as **superclass (base class, parent class)**.


### extends Keyword
**extends** is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class.
