# Maven and Gradle

## Maven 
The main benefit of Maven is its life cycle. While following the same life cycle for multiple projects continuously, this comes a cost of flexibility. Maven also faces some problems in dependency management. It does not handle well conflicts between versions of the same library, and complex customized build scripts are actually harder to write in Maven than in ANT.
