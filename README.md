## What is it?  
This is my multi-month study plan or review plan to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. Actually, even if you are not in the field of web developement, I believe knowledges in web development would definitely help.  
    
However, some problems may occur when you are starting to learn web development:
   * Never know how to start and what to learn?
   * Lots of knowledges are not covered in schoool.  
   * Materials, references and videos are so complex online that hard to distinguish whether they are good or not.  
   * Web technologies develope so fast that cannot catch.  
   * ...
   
The solution is this tutorial, or study-list.   

If you have many years of software/web development experience, this study-list also could be your checklist to review.
