# WebTechnologies
> Tutorials and materials related to web technologies are so mess online. That's why I created this as a to-do list of study topics for becoming a full-stack developer, or even web scientists.  
<br>
> Hope it will contain everything we need for web development one day.  
<br>
> You can go into each directory for more details.  
<br>
> Coding is always mandatory.  
<br> 
> Keep Updating.
