Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store.
An in-memory key-value store, with persistence.
Open source.
Written in C.
NoSQL database.

Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building highperformance, scalable web applications.
(can function as a NoSQL database or as a memory-cache store to improve performance when serving data that is stored in system memory)
Redis has three main peculiarities that sets it apart:
1. Redis holds its database entirely in the memory, using the disk only for persistence.
2. Redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.
3. Redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.

How to interact with Redis?
Once installed in a server, run the Redis CLI(Command Line Interface) to issue commands to Redis. While working on the CLI tool, the command-line prompt will change to:
redis>

Operation System:
Windows
The Redis project does not officially support Windows. However, the Microsoft Open Tech group develops and maintains this Windows port targeting Win64.(Till to now Sep.26 2017)
(https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis  -> https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases)

For windows:
Start Server:
D:\Program\Redis\Redis-x64-3.2.100>redis-server.exe redis.windows.conf

Start Client:
redis-cli.exe

In Client:
redis 127.0.0.1:6379>
In the above prompt, 127.0.0.1 is your machine's IP address and 6379 is the port on which Redis server is running. Now type the following PING command.

redis 127.0.0.1:6379> ping 
PONG
This shows that Redis is successfully installed on your machine.

127.0.0.1:6379> set name Mark
OK
// Set the key name and its value is Mark

127.0.0.1:6379> get name
"Mark"
